The new helm chart version 3.2.0 introduces a new structure for the configuration of the **crypto engines** and **connectors**. The new structure is more flexible and allows for a more detailed configuration of the crypto engines and connectors without coupling them too much to the helm chart itself. 

## Crypto Engines

Previously, crypto engines were defined under the `services.ca.engines` key. In the new version, the crypto engines are defined under the `services.ca.cryptoEngines` key. The new structure allows for a more detailed configuration of the crypto engines. The `type` key is used to define the type of the crypto engine. The following types are supported: `filesystem`, `aws_kms`, `aws_secrets_manager`, `pkcs11`, `hashicorp_vault`. There is no longer a dedicated map for each crypto engine, but a list of crypto engines. Engines now are defined as a list of items, where each item is a map with the following keys: `id`, `type`, and other keys that are specific to the crypto engine type (those properties have not changed at all).

Another Key core change affects the old golang, now named filesystem engines. The `storage_directory` key now must point to  `/crypto/fs` instead of `/data`.

OLD (3.1.1): 
```yaml
services:
  ca:
    engines:
      defaultEngineID: "golang-1"
      golang:

          module_path: /usr/local/lib/libpkcs11-proxy.so
          module_extra_options:
            env:
              PKCS11_PROXY_SOCKET: tcp://hsm-softhsm:5657
      hashicorpVault:

          role_id: XXXXXXXXXX
          secret_id: XXXXXXXXXX
          auto_unseal_enabled: true          
          mount_path: /secret
          protocol: http
          hostname: vault
          port: 8200
```

NEW (3.2.0):
```yaml
services:
  ca:
    cryptoEngines:
      defaultEngineID: "golang-1"
      engines:
        - id: golang-1
          type: filesystem
          storage_directory: /crypto/fs
        - id: aws-kms-1
          type: aws_kms

          hostname: vault
          port: 8200
```


## Connectors

Previously, connectors were only limited to AWS-based connectors,  defined under the `services.awsConnector` key. In the new version, the connectors are defined under the `services.connectors` key. The new structure allows for a more detailed configuration of the connectors. The `type` key is used to define the type of the connector. The following types are supported: `awsiot`, `emqx`. There is no longer a dedicated map for each connector, but a list of connectors. Connectors now are defined as a list of items, where each item is a map with the following keys: `id`, `type`, `image`, and other keys that are specific to the connector type (those properties have not changed at all).

OLD (3.1.1): 
```yaml
services:
  awsConnector:
    image: ghcr.io/lamassuiot/lamassu-aws-connector:2.8.0
    instances:
    - connectorID: "aws.my-connector-1"
      credentials:
        auth_method: static
        region: eu-west-1
        access_key_id: XXXXXXXXXX
        secret_access_key: XXXXXXXXXX 
    - connectorID: "aws.my-connector-2"
      credentials:
        auth_method: static
        region: eu-west-1
        access_key_id: XXXXXXXXXX
        secret_access_key: XXXXXXXXXX
```

NEW (3.2.0):
```yaml
services:
  connectors:
    - id: "aws.my-connector-1"
      type: awsiot
      image: ghcr.io/lamassuiot/lamassu-aws-connector:3.2.2
      credentials:
        auth_method: static
        region: eu-west-1

    - id: "aws.my-connector-2"
      type: awsiot
      image: ghcr.io/lamassuiot/lamassu-aws-connector:3.2.2
      credentials:
