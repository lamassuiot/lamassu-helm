# Migration guide from 3.3.0 to 3.3.1


### UPDATED auth.oidc.apiGateway

Starting from version 3.3.1 it is allowed to define a collection of JWKS providers to support multiple OIDC providers. Bare in mind, if authentication service is deployed in kubernetes, since the gateway is deployed in its own Namespace, you will need to indicate not only the hostname but the namespace as well to have a FQDN to access the authn service as indicated in [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/).

> [!WARNING]
> The following example assumes the auth service is deployed in `lamassu-dev` namespace. Change it accordingly.


**OLD (3.3.0):**
```yaml
auth:
  oidc:
    apiGateway: 
      jwks:
        protocol: http
        host: auth-keycloak
        port: 80
        path: /auth/realms/lamassu/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```

**NEW (3.3.1):**
```yaml
auth:
  oidc:
    apiGateway: 
      jwks:
        - name: oidc-authn
          uri: http://auth-keycloak.lamassu-dev/auth/realms/lamassu/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```
