# Migration guide from 3.0.0 -> 3.2.0

Upgrading from 3.1.1 to 3.2.0 requires some manual steps to be performed. The following sections describe the changes that need to be made in order to successfully upgrade the Lamassu Helm chart.

## Postgres DB: Initialize Migration Table

Starting from version 3.2.0, Lamassu's Backend will manage DB schema **upgrade** migrations automatically (Rollbacks are NOT supported). In order to differentiate a fresh install from an upgrade, it is required to exec the following commands just once

> [!WARNING]
> The following commands **MUST** be executed before performing the helm upgrade to version 3.2.0. Failure to do so may result in an inconsistent database state.

```bash
kubectl exec -n lamassu-dev postgresql-0 -- env PGPASSWORD=$PASSWORD psql -U $USERNAME -d ca -c "INSERT INTO goose_db_version (version_id, is_applied, tstamp) VALUES(1, true, now());"
kubectl exec -n lamassu-dev postgresql-0 -- env PGPASSWORD=$PASSWORD psql -U $USERNAME -d dmsmanager -c "INSERT INTO goose_db_version (version_id, is_applied, tstamp) VALUES(1, true, now());"
kubectl exec -n lamassu-dev postgresql-0 -- env PGPASSWORD=$PASSWORD psql -U $USERNAME -d devmanager -c "INSERT INTO goose_db_version (version_id, is_applied, tstamp) VALUES(1, true, now());"
kubectl exec -n lamassu-dev postgresql-0 -- env PGPASSWORD=$PASSWORD psql -U $USERNAME -d alerts -c "INSERT INTO goose_db_version (version_id, is_applied, tstamp) VALUES(1, true, now());"
```

## Update Helm values.yaml (aka lamassu.yaml)

The new helm chart version 3.2.0 introduces a new structure for the configuration of the **crypto engines** and **connectors**. The new structure is more flexible and allows for a more detailed configuration of the crypto engines and connectors without coupling them too much to the helm chart itself. 

### Crypto Engines

Previously, crypto engines were defined under the `services.ca.engines` key. In the new version, the crypto engines are defined under the `services.ca.cryptoEngines` key. The new structure allows for a more detailed configuration of the crypto engines. The `type` key is used to define the type of the crypto engine. The following types are supported: `filesystem`, `aws_kms`, `aws_secrets_manager`, `pkcs11`, `hashicorp_vault`. There is no longer a dedicated map for each crypto engine, but a list of crypto engines. Engines now are defined as a list of items, where each item is a map with the following keys: `id`, `type`, and other keys that are specific to the crypto engine type (those properties have not changed at all).

Another Key core change affects the old golang, now named filesystem engines. The `storage_directory` key now must point to  `/crypto/fs` instead of `/data`.

**OLD (3.1.1):** 
```yaml
services:
  ca:
    engines:
      defaultEngineID: "golang-1"
      golang:
        - id: golang-1

      awsKms:
        - id: aws-kms-1

          token: lamassuHSM
          pin: "1234"
          module_path: /usr/local/lib/libpkcs11-proxy.so
          module_extra_options:
            env:
              PKCS11_PROXY_SOCKET: tcp://hsm-softhsm:5657
      hashicorpVault:
        - id: hashicorp-vault-1
          role_id: XXXXXXXXXX
          secret_id: XXXXXXXXXX
          auto_unseal_enabled: true          
          mount_path: /secret
          protocol: http
          hostname: vault
          port: 8200
```

**NEW (3.2.0):**
```yaml
services:
  ca:
    cryptoEngines:
      defaultEngineID: "golang-1"
      engines:
        - id: golang-1
          type: filesystem
          storage_directory: /crypto/fs
        - id: aws-kms-1
          type: aws_kms

          type: hashicorp_vault

          protocol: http
          hostname: vault
          port: 8200
```


### Connectors

Previously, connectors were only limited to AWS-based connectors,  defined under the `services.awsConnector` key. In the new version, the connectors are defined under the `services.connectors` key. The new structure allows for a more detailed configuration of the connectors. The `type` key is used to define the type of the connector. The following types are supported: `awsiot`, `emqx`. There is no longer a dedicated map for each connector, but a list of connectors. Connectors now are defined as a list of items, where each item is a map with the following keys: `id`, `type`, `image`, and other keys that are specific to the connector type (those properties have not changed at all).

**OLD (3.1.1):** 
```yaml
services:
  awsConnector:
    image: ghcr.io/lamassuiot/lamassu-aws-connector:2.8.0
    instances:
    - connectorID: "aws.my-connector-1"
      credentials:
        auth_method: static
        region: eu-west-1
        access_key_id: XXXXXXXXXX
        secret_access_key: XXXXXXXXXX 
    - connectorID: "aws.my-connector-2"
      credentials:
        auth_method: static
        region: eu-west-1
        access_key_id: XXXXXXXXXX
        secret_access_key: XXXXXXXXXX
```

**NEW (3.2.0):**
```yaml
services:
  connectors:
    - id: "aws.my-connector-1"
      type: awsiot
      image: ghcr.io/lamassuiot/lamassu-aws-connector:3.2.2
      credentials:
        auth_method: static
        region: eu-west-1
        access_key_id: XXXXXXXXXX
        secret_access_key: XXXXXXXXXX 
    - id: "aws.my-connector-2"
      type: awsiot
      image: ghcr.io/lamassuiot/lamassu-aws-connector:3.2.2
      credentials:
        auth_method: static
        region: eu-west-1
        access_key_id: XXXXXXXXXX
